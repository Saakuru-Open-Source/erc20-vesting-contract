# ERC20 vesting contract

Vesting contracts are essential tools that allow projects to manage the distribution of ERC20 tokens through a secure and structured process. These contracts enable the secure locking of tokens and the establishment of a clear vesting schedule. Once the tokens are unlocked according to this schedule, eligible wallets can then withdraw their vested amounts at their convenience. This mechanism ensures a transparent and fair distribution of tokens, aligning the interests of the project's stakeholders over time.
